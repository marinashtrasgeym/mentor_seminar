Sveta is a little girl. She is only 5. She is a very nice girl 
with fair hair and blue eyes. She likes to sing and dance. She 
also likes to get presents.
 Today is the 31st of December. She is waiting for Santa 
Claus. She has a New Year’s tree with the candles lighted.
 At last Santa Claus comes and says, “Hello, Sveta. I have a 
present for you.” He puts his hand into his red bag and takes 
out a lovely kitten.
 Sveta is very happy. She says, “Thank you, Santa Claus.”
